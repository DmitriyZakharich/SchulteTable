3) The distance to the table should be about 30-35 cm.

4) Try not to strain your eyes too much. If you feel tired, rest with your eyes closed or do some light exercise for your eyes.

5) Start training by doing no more than 10 tables a day.

6) Try not to say the boxes you have found either by ear or to yourself.

7) If you find it difficult to find the cells you want when you are looking still, make it easier for yourself by moving your gaze up and down strictly in the middle.

8) There are two modes of spreadsheet operation in the app: with or without touching the cells. The second option is more efficient, as you don't waste time tapping a button, and you don't lose focus.

9) When working with two tables, you can either move your gaze to the center of the desired table each time, or fix it between the tables. Both options have their advantages. For example, moving your gaze from one table to another will train your attention span. Looking between tables will better train your peripheral vision.
