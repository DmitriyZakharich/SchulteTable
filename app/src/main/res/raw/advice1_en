A Schulte table is a table with randomly placed letters or numbers on it. It is used to improve concentration as well as to develop peripheral vision. Both of these skills are useful on their own and as part of speed reading training.
1) Your gaze should be directed to the center of the table and be as still as possible. Example:
2) With sideways vision you have to find all the numbers or letters in ascending order. In two-table mode, you must find the cells in the first table in ascending order and the cells in the second table in descending order.
3) The distance to the table should be about 30-35 cm.
4) Try not to strain your eyes too much. If you feel tired, rest with your eyes closed or do some light exercise for your eyes.
5) Start training by doing no more than 10 tables a day.
6) Try not to say the boxes you have found either by ear or to yourself.
7) If you find it difficult to find the cells you want when you are looking still, make it easier for yourself by moving your gaze up and down strictly in the middle.
8) There are two modes of spreadsheet operation in the app: with or without touching the cells. The second option is more efficient, as you don't waste time tapping a button, and you don't lose focus.
9) When working with two tables, you can either move your gaze to the center of the desired table each time, or fix it between the tables. Both options have their advantages. For example, moving your gaze from one table to another will train your attention span. Looking between tables will better train your peripheral vision.
If your main objective when working with spreadsheets is to increase your reading speed and you are using a smartphone, the width of your device may not be sufficient for a full workout. Therefore, we recommend holding your smartphone horizontally. This will allow you to train your peripheral vision width more quickly, which is primarily needed in order to perceive whole lines at once.
